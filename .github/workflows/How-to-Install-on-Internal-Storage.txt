## Install on eMMC for UEFI
1.
Once Raspberry Pi OS has booted from USB. 
Go to Start menu -> Accessories -> SD Card Copier. 
Select the USB drive as the "From". 
Select the eMMC (mine was MBG4GA) as the "To". 
Check the box that says "New Partition UUIDs". Click Start
2.
Edit the startup.nsh (on the eMMC boot partition, that was just copied to) and change the root=/dev/sda2 to root=/dev/mmcblk0p2. Then save.
3.
Once the Copy has finished (with no errors), shutdown the Surface RT, remove the USB drive, then power on the Surface RT normally. (do not hold Vol. down)

## Post Install
If you want to install Raspi OS on eMMC do the steps below after booting from eMMC.

There is only one thing to do after you can see the desktop.
Open the Terminal and enter sudo raspi-config 
Choose Advanced Options
Choose Expand Filesystem
Now your SD Card / eMMC is writable and can use all of its space.
